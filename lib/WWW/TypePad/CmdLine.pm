Welcome to WWW::TypePad! Before we get started, we'll need to link our
local configuration to your TypePad account.

First, you'll need to authorize this application in your web browser.

        callback => 'oob',

We're opening this URL in your web browser:

$auth_uri

    } else {
        print <<MSG;
Open this URL in your web browser:

$auth_uri
MSG
    }

    print <<MSG;

When you've allowed access to this application, you'll get a verifier
code that we'll need to complete the handshake.

Great! We've identified you as "$obj->{displayName}".

We're going to save your configuration in the following file, in case you'd
like to access or change it in the future:

    $Config

=head1 NAME

WWW::TypePad::CmdLine - Helper library for writing WWW::TypePad apps

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use WWW::TypePad::CmdLine;
    
    # Returns a WWW::TypePad instance, initialized with the necessary
    # consumer key/secret and access token/secret.
    my $tp = WWW::TypePad::CmdLine->initialize( requires_auth => 1 );

    # Then, you can do something like this:
    my $user = $tp->users->get( '@self' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<WWW::TypePad::CmdLine> is a helper library for writing command-line
applications that use I<WWW::TypePad>. It handles the one-time OAuth
authentication flow, config file setup, and storage of access tokens.

Tokens and configuration are stored between runs of your application in
a config file. By default, that config file will be located at:

    File::Spec->catfile( File::HomeDir->my_data, '.www-typepad-info' )

I<File::HomeDir-E<gt>my_data> is an OS-aware data directory. On OS X, for
example, it's F<~/Library/Application Support>.

I<WWW::TypePad::CmdLine> automatically adds a C<--config> command-line
option for your application, so that it's easy to support different locations
for configuration files.

On the first execution of a script using I<WWW::TypePad::CmdLine>, you'll
need to set the C<TP_CONSUMER_KEY> and C<TP_CONSUMER_SECRET> environment
variables to the consumer key and secret for your TypePad application,
respectively. You can also set C<TP_HOST> to a host other than
C<api.typepad.com>. Once the configuration file is saved after the first
call to I<initialize>, future runs of your script won't require these
environment variables.

=head1 USAGE

=head2 WWW::TypePad::CmdLine->initialize( %param )

Initializes and returns a new I<WWW::TypePad> object, initialized with all
of the necessary information to start using it for authenticated requests
(see C<requires_auth>).

The configuration and tokens are stored between runs of your application in
a config file (see above). If the config file doesn't exist, and your
application requires authentication (see C<requires_auth>), I<initialize>
will send the user through the OAuth authentication flow.

When control returns to your application from calling I<initialize>, you'll
have a I<WWW::TypePad> object initialized with everything you need to make
authenticated (or non-authenticated) requests.

I<%param> can contain:

=over 4

=item * requires_auth

Controls whether or not your application requires an authenticated user
in order to function. This controls whether, in the absence of a configuration
file, I<initialize> will send the user through the OAuth authentication flow.
